						<h3>An Invitation to the 'Poor': Fresh Eyes &ndash; New Realities</h3>
						<div class="extra">
							<p>Australian education policy, at national, federal, and state levels, is frequently couched in the language of both excellence (economic) and equity (social). While not mutually exclusive, the simultaneous pursuit of economic advantage is by its very nature rarely socially equitable at scale. This contemporary policy condition creates a wide range of external pressures and internal tensions in the leadership, management and administration of schools. For the contemporary Catholic school the dual masters of economics and equity are an explicit part of our everyday work and location within both the church and the state.</p>
							<p>Although it is easy to demonstrate the negative impact that performative regimes have on leaders, staff and students and to long for the ideal of a socially just utopia, engaging with and not just about policy is difficult. School systems, individual schools and staff are not only embedded, but embody the contemporary policy conditions. This creates an opportunity to speak back to policy and recast our role/s in shaping the conditions in which we work. In this paper I will integrate the theoretical argument with empirical examples of how schools, and individual leaders, have challenged the orthodoxy of 'quality' education in contemporary Australia.</p>
